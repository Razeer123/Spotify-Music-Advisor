# Spotify Music Advisor - Work in progress!

This is Java app that I'm currently working on as a JetBrains Academy Assignment. It will serve as a simple Music Advisor integrated with Spotify. Its purpose is to show capabilities of connecting Java apps to servers, displaying downloaded information and using external API. **Right now it's on an early stage of development. More features will be added soon!**

# Features 🖥

- Authorize and connect to Spotify servers
- Download and display information about many categories, playlists and recently added songs

# What's working ✅

- Full integration with Spotify Web API (app authorizes user and downloads data from Spotify servers)
